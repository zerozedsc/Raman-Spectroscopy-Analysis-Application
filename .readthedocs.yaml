# Read the Docs configuration file for Sphinx documentation
#
# IMPORTANT:
# This repository keeps English and Japanese sources in separate trees:
#   - docs/en/**
#   - docs/ja/**
#
# If you use Read the Docs' built-in "Translations" feature, RTD will already
# prefix URLs with the language (e.g. /en/latest/ and /ja/latest/). Therefore
# each RTD project should build a language tree as its *documentation root*
# (so URLs are /en/latest/index.html, not /en/latest/en/index.html).
#
# This file is the ENGLISH project's config.
# The JAPANESE translation project should use `.readthedocs.ja.yaml`.
#
