# Read the Docs configuration file for Sphinx documentation
#
# Note: Read the Docs requires one project per language for the built-in
# "Translations" feature. This single config is intended to be used by both the
# parent (English) project and its translation projects (e.g. Japanese).
#
# The Sphinx config at docs/conf.py selects which subtree to build using
# READTHEDOCS_LANGUAGE.
