# Read the Docs configuration file (English project)
#
# RTD translations already prefix URLs with the language (/en/latest/, /ja/latest/).
# This config therefore builds docs/en/** as the documentation ROOT so pages are:
#   /en/latest/index.html
# (no duplicated /en/ path segment).
#
# In the Read the Docs project settings, set "Build configuration file" to:
#   .readthedocs/en/.readthedocs.yaml
#
# See https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/config-file/v2.html
